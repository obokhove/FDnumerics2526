Numerics ex2 contains solutions to exercise and each test case.
Test case 0, 1, 2 were run using code provided.
Test case 3 code is a modified version of code, where expressions for test case 2 were replaced by ones needed for 3.
This code can be found in test3.py
Issues with this code though, as it seems to work for delta_x = 1, and CFL=0.5, but if time step is decreased by setting CFL=0.25, it breaks.
But works fine with larger time steps and larger space steps weirdly.
