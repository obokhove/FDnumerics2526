## GitHub instructions
Please make a folder with your name and therein a readme.md : e.g. <yourname>/readme.md
Then add a subfolder for each exercise. Each subfolder should have clear simulation and read-through instructions in its readme.md

One creates a folder by making a file "onnob/readme" say (so "onnob" before the "/" takes care that readme.md is stored in the folder "onnob"). Pull down "Add file icon".

## Finite-difference exercise
Two example Python files: ex251intdiff.py and ex251waveqnex.py with sample exercise ex25_1example.pdf.
Exercise one is found in ex25_1.pdf
