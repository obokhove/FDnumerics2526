# FDnumerics2025

## GitHub instructions
Please make a folder with your name and therein a readme.md : e.g. <yourname>/readme.md
Then add a subfolder for each exercise. Each subfolder should have clear simulation and read-through instructions in its readme.md

One creates a folder by making a file "onnob/readme" say (so "onnob" before the "/" takes care that readme.md is stored in the folder "onnob"). Pull down "Add file icon".

## Finite-difference exercise
Two example Python files: ex251intdiff.py and ex251waveqnex.py with sample exercise ex25_1example.pdf.
Exercise one is found in ex25_1.pdf (typo in eqn (9) corrected; added alpha=0 remark).

## Finite-volume exercise
Please put in a (collective) ITY-request to install Firedrake and/or try to do so via the Docker. 

Firedrake (installation and examples) https://www.firedrakeproject.org/documentation.html

Two download options: follow native-installation linux instructions (e.g. use chatgpt/etc) or use the "Dockers image" (link part way donw the documentation page). Native installations is circa 50% faster.

I have put the FD-FV lecture slides in the respective FVDG) folder. Please also see the url-links to related lectures.



## Finite-element exercise
Please put in a (collective) ITY-request to install Firedrake and/or try to do so via the Docker. 

The exercise on FEM modelling via Firedrake is/will be found in the FEM folder.

Sample Firedrake programs:
- for Poisson equation (codes in named folder) via weak formulation and minimisation (Yang Lu with Robin Furze, added comments by OB)
- Load Firedrake environment, go to directory with (downloaded) file
- To run code type >> python3 Poissons_eq_v2.py
